## What is rm-r.org, really?

In short, rm-r.org is simply a place where anyone can publish anything,
almost. It is a place for like-minded people to share their works with each
other and the world. There is no restrictions on what medium is used, as long as
the content follows **the rules**.

## The Rules

- Postings *must* follow the values outlined [here](/index.html)

- Postings can be in any language

- Only one posting per month is allowed per person.
  - Attempting to evade this restriction will result in a ban

- Nothing explicit (sexually or with gore)
  - Instant automatically-issued ban, do not even try

- Nothing racist, sexist, or otherwise hateful
  - If a posting is deemed so, it will undergo a review by me and if it's bad
    you'll get a warn or a ban.

- Nothing illegal or dangerous
  - Will result in an instant ban and a report to law enforcement

## Contact

While having official discussion places is cool, and undoubtedly leads to
awesome friendships, community, and culture, it is not what I believe is right
for rm-r.org. When I registered the rm-r.org domain all the way back in 2023, my
goal was not to create a community in the traditional sense, but rather create a
place where myself, and potentially others can publish projects of literary,
philosophical, mathematical, or scientific nature that do not fit well on
"personal website"-type websites. I find that while community chat rooms are
cool, they would somewhat detract from the experience I am trying to
create. Thus, there is no official central discussion forum or chatroom for
rm-r.org. Everyone is free to submit an article, work, or anything they like and
it will get published as long as it follows **the rules**.

That being said, rm-r.org definitely does encourage collaboration. There are a
few places where regular rm-r.org members habitually hang out in:

- Discord Servers
  - Nullring Discord -- [link](https://discord.gg/pJU8dTKNWq)
  
- IRC channels
  - #nullring on nullring.xyz, port 6697 (less reliable)

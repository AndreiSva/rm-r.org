[rm-r.org](https://rm-r.org) in its essence is an internet club. However, to me it is more than that. [rm-r.org](https://rm-r.org) is the culmination of years of discussions, friends, and philosophy. It is my attempt to create a community of likeminded people who care about furthering the power of and the knowledge of humanity through technology and writing.
